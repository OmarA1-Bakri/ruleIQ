- ❌ LangSmith tracing

### State Persistence (50% passing)
- ✅ Recovery after crash
- ❌ Checkpoint save and restore

### Cost Governance (100% passing)
- ✅ Budget enforcement
- ✅ Token usage tracking

### Compliance & Security (50% passing)

## 🔧 Implementation Gaps Identified

### Missing Dependencies
1. **Twilio** - Required for SMS delivery
2. **slack_sdk** - Required for Slack notifications
3. **fcm** - Required for push notifications
4. **audit_logger** - Required for audit logging

### Code Issues to Fix
1. **Error Handler Integration**: ErrorHandlerNode missing `handle_error` method
2. **Async Processing**: Batch parallel processing has await issue
3. **Circuit Breaker**: Implementation incomplete
4. **Dead Letter Queue**: Implementation incomplete
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implementation incomplete
6. **LangSmith Tracing**: Integration incomplete
7. **Checkpoint Persistence**: Save/restore mechanism incomplete

### Test Issues
1. Mock setup issues in email delivery test
2. Empty error messages in some failed tests need investigation

## 📊 Coverage Analysis

### Well-Covered Areas
- Basic state transitions
- Template rendering
- Priority queue logic
- Cost tracking
- PII redaction

### Needs Coverage
- External service integrations (SMS, Slack, Push)
- Advanced retry patterns (circuit breaker, DLQ)
- Rate limiting mechanisms
- Distributed tracing
- Database checkpoint persistence

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix Critical Bugs
1. Fix ErrorHandlerNode integration
2. Fix async batch processing
3. Implement circuit breaker properly
4. Implement dead letter queue

### Priority 2: Add Missing Features
1. Complete rate limiting implementation
2. Add LangSmith tracing integration
3. Fix checkpoint save/restore mechanism

### Priority 3: External Dependencies
1. Add mock implementations for Twilio
2. Add mock implementations for Slack SDK
3. Add mock implementations for FCM
4. Create audit_logger module or mock

## Recommendations

1. **Mock External Services**: Instead of requiring actual SDK installations, create mock implementations for testing
2. **Fix Core Logic First**: Focus on the 50% of tests that are failing due to implementation bugs
3. **Improve Error Messages**: Several tests fail with empty error messages, need better error handling
4. **Complete TDD Cycle**: Once all tests pass, refactor for production readiness

## Conclusion

The notification migration has achieved 50% test coverage with core functionality working. The main gaps are in external service integrations and advanced retry/resilience patterns. With focused effort on the identified issues, we can achieve the target 100% test coverage.
