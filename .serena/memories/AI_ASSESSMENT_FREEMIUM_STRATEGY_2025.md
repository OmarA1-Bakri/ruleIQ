# AI Assessment Freemium Strategy - August 2025

## üìç MARKED CHECKPOINT - Current Position
- **Date**: August 5, 2025
- **Status**: Strategy defined, ready for implementation
- **Next Exercise**: Implementation of AI Assessment Freemium Strategy

## User's Strategic Vision

### Core Strategy: Email-Gated AI Assessment Funnel
1. **Remove agent onboarding system** (current RBAC blocks assessment access)
2. **Create free AI-driven assessment tool** on landing page (not static questions)
3. **Email capture required** - users must signup to newsletter for free assessment access
4. **Freemium conversion** - AI shows compliance gaps, offers paid subscription for full results

### Key Requirements Identified
- **AI-driven questions**: Replace static hardcoded questions in `services/assessment_service.py:226`
- **Public access**: Remove RBAC permissions (`assessment_create`, `assessment_list`) that block access
- **Email gate**: Newsletter signup required before assessment access
- **Conversion flow**: "AI found X gaps ‚Üí Get Compliant Now ‚Üí Payment link"

## Technical Context Discovered

### Current Assessment System Analysis
- **Static questions**: 5 stages hardcoded in `get_assessment_questions()` method
- **RBAC protected**: Users need permissions that test users don't have
- **Location**: `services/assessment_service.py` lines 226-389
- **Structure**: Basic Info ‚Üí Data Handling ‚Üí Tech Stack ‚Üí Compliance Posture ‚Üí Goals

### Browser Testing Results Completed
- ‚úÖ Backend running (port 8000) with working JWT auth
- ‚úÖ Frontend running (port 3000) with working teal theme
- ‚úÖ Test user created: test@ruleiq.com (but lacks assessment permissions)
- ‚úÖ Static questions confirmed (user was correct - they don't change)
- ‚úÖ API endpoints discovered and tested
- ‚úÖ Teal migration verified working

### AI Infrastructure Available
- Existing AI services in `services/ai/` directory
- Circuit breaker patterns already implemented
- Rate limiting configured (20/min for AI endpoints)

## üéØ NEXT EXERCISE: Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Create complete spec for AI assessment freemium flow
2. Remove RBAC restrictions on assessments
3. Build email capture form on landing page

### Phase 2: AI Assessment Engine
4. Replace static questions with AI-driven assessment engine
5. Implement dynamic question generation based on user responses
6. Connect to existing AI infrastructure

### Phase 3: Conversion Flow
7. Design freemium results page with high-level summary
8. Implement "Get Compliant Now" conversion flow
9. Integrate payment system for subscription

### Phase 4: Lead Generation
10. Connect email capture to newsletter/CRM system
11. Implement assessment data for lead segmentation
12. Add conversion tracking

## Technical Changes Required
1. **Assessment Service**: Replace hardcoded questions with AI calls
2. **Landing Page**: Add email capture form with assessment CTA
3. **RBAC**: Remove authentication barriers for public assessment access
4. **Results Page**: Design freemium conversion with payment integration
5. **Newsletter Integration**: Connect email capture to marketing system

## Project Context
