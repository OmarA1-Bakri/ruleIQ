## Executive summary
The current front-end shows strong functional breadth but lacks a cohesive visual system and modern motion/interaction polish. Inconsistent spacing, typographic scale, and component variants reduce clarity and perceived quality. Accessibility is partial; color contrast and focus states require standardization. Performance can be improved for LCP and input responsiveness by optimizing hero media, reducing layout shift, and refining hydration. The revamp will unify brand expression across landing, auth, dashboard, and assessments with a consistent design language, accessible components, and performance budgets. Targets: WCAG 2.2 AA, under 2.5 s LCP on 3G, sub-100 ms interaction latency.

## Holistic front-end audit scope
- Visual identity and branding: color roles, elevation, spacing rhythm, iconography alignment
- Interaction and flows: landing hero clarity, dual CTAs, trust signals; auth friction; assessments progress and autosave
- Components: unify buttons, inputs, cards, banners, toasts, modals with variants and tokens
- Accessibility: landmarks, skip link, focus order, aria labels, error association, contrast verification
- Performance: fonts preconnect and fallback, responsive images, reduced hydration, skeletons, suspense

## Staged improvement plan
- Stage 0 Baselines and tokens: implement design tokens and type ramp; wire theme provider across app
- Stage 1 Landing hero: rebuild hero, trust signals, responsive media; set LCP KPI and CLS budget
- Stage 2 Auth flows: update login and signup with error handling and SSO affordances
- Stage 3 Dashboard and widgets: restructure shell; widget grid with suspense and skeletons
- Stage 4 Assessments flow: progress rail, card layout, sticky actions; keyboard-first controls
- Stage 5 A11y and Performance pass: Lighthouse CI budgets, axe checks, keyboard testing
- Stage 6 Handover: style guide, examples, contribution rules, commit scopes

## Risks and dependencies
- Token rollout may cause regressions; use phased adoption and visual diffing
- Hero media may require CDN and responsive art direction
- SSO visual parity depends on provider configuration and copy alignment


## Audit log: Landing page (frontend/app/(public))

Checklist
- [ ] Visual identity: consistent color roles, spacing rhythm, iconography alignment
- [ ] Typography: apply defined type ramp; check headings hierarchy and line-length
- [ ] Layout: hero grid responsive at 320, 768, 1024, 1280; safe areas respected
- [ ] CTAs: primary/secondary contrast, hit area ≥44x44, clear affordances
- [ ] Trust signals: logo row responsive, alt text present
- [ ] Accessibility: landmarks, skip link, focus order, visible focus ring, aria-labels
- [ ] Performance: LCP image optimized, width/height set, priority, preload as needed; CLS ≤0.1
- [ ] Motion: prefers-reduced-motion respects; non-blocking decorative animations

Metrics to capture
- LCP (3G): target ≤2.5s
- CLS: target ≤0.1
- INP: target <100ms
- Lighthouse a11y score: ≥95

Initial findings
- Pending: locate landing route within frontend/app/(public) and enumerate hero components, media assets, and section structure.
- Action: identify LCP candidate image/video, measure current LCP and CLS, verify font loading strategy (preconnect, display), and check focus visibility.

Planned fixes (landing hero)
- Replace hero media with responsive sources and explicit dimensions; set priority for LCP asset.
- Normalize spacing and type scale to style guide snippet; unify CTA variants.
- Add skip link and ensure header/main landmarks; confirm visible keyboard focus.
- Preconnect fonts and adjust font-display to optional; ensure fallback stack with minimal layout shift.
