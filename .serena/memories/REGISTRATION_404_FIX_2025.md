# Registration 404 Error Fix - January 2025

## Issue Identified
- Frontend registration page was making direct fetch calls to `/api/auth/register`
- Backend auth endpoints are mounted at `/api/v1/auth/register`
- This caused 404 "not found" errors during user registration

## Root Cause
- Register page (`frontend/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx`) was using hardcoded fetch calls instead of the auth store
- URL mismatch: frontend called `/api/auth/register` but backend serves `/api/v1/auth/register`

## Solution Implemented
1. **Updated register page to use auth store**: Replaced direct fetch calls with `useAuthStore().register()`
2. **Fixed imports**: Added `import { useAuthStore } from "@/lib/stores/auth.store"`
3. **Updated state management**: 
   - Replaced local `loading` state with `isLoading` from auth store
   - Added `authError` from auth store to error display
4. **Simplified error handling**: Auth store handles all API communication and error states

## Files Modified
- `frontend/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx`: Complete refactor to use auth store

## Verification
- Backend logs show 404 errors stopped after implementing auth store usage
- Auth store already has correct `/api/v1/auth/register` endpoint configured
- Registration now uses proper JWT token handling and user state management

## Benefits
- Consistent auth flow across the application
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Centralized auth logic in the store
- No more hardcoded API URLs in components
